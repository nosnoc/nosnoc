%% Description
% In this example a swing up of a pendulum on a cart subject to friction is
% treated. 
% The script allows to solve the problem with a smoothed friction model and
% standard direct collocation, to compare to a nonsmooth friction model and
% nosnoc please run cart_pole_nonsmooth 
% This allows to explore the drawbacks of naive smoothing, e.g., if started
% with a very low smoothing parameter.
% For more details see: https://www.syscop.de/files/2023ss/nonsmooth_school/ex1_sol.pdf
