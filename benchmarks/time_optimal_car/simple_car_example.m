%% About
% This script provids a tutoral how to formulate a time-optimal control
% problme of a simple car with two modes of operation.
% When the car exceeds a certain velocity treshold, its acceleration
% improves by the factor of 3 (turbo mode). For more information see the
% github page, the manual and the NOS-NOC related publications.
