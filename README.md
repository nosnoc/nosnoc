# `nosnoc`
**nosnoc** is an open-source `MATLAB` software package for NOnSmooth Numerical Optimal Control.
The `Python` package `nosnoc_py` with similar functionality is available as well.


- Documnetation is [avilable here](https://nosnoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

- A detailed overview of the theory and methods behind nosnoc can be found in the course material of the
[Summer School on Direct Methods for Optimal Control of Nonsmooth Systems](https://www.syscop.de/teaching/ss2023/summer-school-direct-methods-optimal-control-nonsmooth-systems).


## General
**nosnoc** is a tool for numerically solving optimal control problems with nonsmooth dynamical systems that have switches and/or state jumps. It supports:

1. **Automatic discretization via the FESD method**:
   - High accuracy and correct sensitivities.
   - Classical time-stepping methods only have first-order accuracy and incorrect sensitivities, even when they appear to be differentiable.

2. **Automatic reformulations of systems with state jumps**:
   - For example, contact problems via time-freezing into Filippov systems/Piecewise Smooth Systems (PSS).
   - This enables high accuracy even for systems with state jumps.

3. **Solving nonsmooth nonlinear programs via homotopy methods**:
   - Supports numerous relaxation-based algorithms for solving mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCCs). 
   - Enables the use of off-the-shelf solvers like IPOPT and SNOPT.

With **nosnoc**, one can solve optimal control problems subject to several classes of hybrid and nonsmooth systems:
- Switched systems
- Piecewise affine, piecewise smooth systems
- Filippov systems
- Systems with logical Heaviside step functions
- Relay systems
- Projected dynamical systems
- First-order Sweeping processes
- Rigid body models with impacts and friction
- Hybrid systems with hysteresis

Users may directly provide a DCS or the problem in a standard form which is automatically reformulated into a DCS.
**nosnoc** discretizes a Dynamic Complementarity System (DCS) with the FESD method and solves the resulting MPCCs. 



## Installation

**nosnoc** requires `CasADi` version 3.5.5 and Matlab version R2021b or later.

### Installation for MATLAB

1.  Install  `CasADi` and make sure it is added to your `MATLAB` path.
For `CasADi` installation instructions follow visit: https://web.casadi.org/get/

2.   Clone this repository
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nosnoc/nosnoc.git
```

3. Open the `nosnoc` folder in Matlab and run the `install_nosnoc` script
```
>> install_nosnoc
```

Note that `IPOPT` is shipped with `CasADi`. More information including detailed documentation can be found on its [homepage](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/ )

### Installation for python

Go to the [nosnoc_py](https://github.com/nosnoc/nosnoc_py) repository for more info.

## Using nosnoc

The interface of **nosnoc** is based on the symbolic modeling framework [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/). User inputs should be provided as `CasADi` expressions.

To get started, we recommend you look into our example libraries for:
- [MATLAB](https://github.com/nosnoc/nosnoc/tree/main/examples/matlab)
- [Python](https://github.com/nosnoc/nosnoc_py/tree/main/examples)
