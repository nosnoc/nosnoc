# NOSNOC
**NOSNOC** is an open-source `MATLAB` software package for NOnSmooth Numerical Optimal Control.
The `Python` package `nosnoc_py` with similar functionality is available as well.

A detailed overview of the theory and methods behind NOSNOC can be found in the course material of the
[Summer School on Direct Methods for Optimal Control of Nonsmooth Systems](https://www.syscop.de/teaching/ss2023/summer-school-direct-methods-optimal-control-nonsmooth-systems).


## General
**NOSNOC** is a tool for numerically solving optimal control problems with nonsmooth dynamical systems with switches and/or state jumps.
It supports:

1. Automatic discretization via the FESD method - high accuracy and correct sensitivities. Note that classical time-stepping methods only have first-order accuracy and wrong sensitivities even when they appear to be differentiable.

2. Automatic reformulations of systems with state jumps (e.g. contact problems) via time-freezing into Filippov systems/PSS.
(enables high accuracy even for systems with state jumps)

3. Solving the nonsmooth nonlinear programs via homotopy methods. Enables the use of off-the-shelf solvers like IPOPT and SNOPT.


**NOSNOC** relies on the recently introduced Finite Elements with Switch Detection (FESD) which enables high accuracy optimal control of systems with switches and jumps.
It enables the treatment of a broad class of nonsmooth systems in a unified way.

NOSNOC offers several ways to treat switched systems, piecewise smooth systems, Filippov systems, hybrid systems, rigid body models with impacts and friction in simulation, and optimal control.
It discretizes a Dynamic Complementarity System (DCS) with the FESD method and solves the resulting mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCCs).
The MPCCs are solved in a homotopy loop with a standard solver like IPOPT or SNOPT.
The user may directly provide a DCS or define the different modes of a Filippov system and the reformulation is automated.

With NOSNOC one can simulate and solve optimal control problems subject to different kinds of nonsmooth systems, by declaring the `dcs_mode`:
1. `settings.dcs_mode = 'Stewart'` - for treating Filippov systems via Stewart's reformulation
2. `settings.dcs_mode = 'Step'` - for treating nonsmooth systems via set valued step functions (covers also all Filippov systems that are treated with Stewart's).
3. `settings.dcs_mode = 'CLS'` - for rigid bodies with friction and impact (also called complementarity Lagrangian systems (CLS)) - uses FESD tailored to CLS.
4. `settings.time_freezing = 1` - and using for the `dcs_mode = Step`, the CLS is reformulated into an equivalent Filippov system and treated with FESD.

## Installation

**NOSNOC** requires `CasADi` version 3.5.5 and Matlab version R2021b or later.

### Installation for MATLAB

1.  Install  `CasADi` and make sure it is added to your `MATLAB` path.
For `CasADi` installation instructions follow visit: https://web.casadi.org/get/

2.   Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/nurkanovic/nosnoc.git
```

3. Open the `NOSNOC` folder in Matlab and add `src` with subdirectories to the path by running:
```
>> addpath(genpath(fullfile(pwd, 'src')))
```

Note that `IPOPT` is shipped with `CasADi`. More information including detailed documentation can be found on its [homepage](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/ )

### Installation for python

Go to the [nosnoc_py](https://github.com/FreyJo/nosnoc_py) repository and clone it.

Afterward,

1. Setup virtual environment:
```
virtualenv env --python=python3
```

2. Source environment:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install
```
pip install -e .
```

## Using NOSNOC

The interface of **NOSNOC** is based on the symbolic modeling framework [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/).
User inputs should be given as `CasADi` expressions.

To get started we recommend you look into our example libraries for
[MATLAB](https://github.com/nurkanovic/nosnoc/tree/main/examples/matlab) or [python](https://github.com/FreyJo/nosnoc_py/tree/main/examples).
